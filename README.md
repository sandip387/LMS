This is a Learning Management System(LMS) I am making as my Campus project work. Hoping to learn many new things in coming days.
At first open the working directory with integrated terminal

run command **npm create vite@latest**<br/>
type y<br/>
provide the product name<br/>
select react and javascript<br/>

now change the directory to created folder<br/>
install node modules with **npm install**<br/>
then try running your program through **npm run dev** command<br/>
